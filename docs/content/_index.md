Reseed is an open-source tool for integrating static sites into subpaths. It processes all your internal links and prepends a defined subpath.

Let's say you have a static site consisting of a number of distinct sections (such as a blog, portfolio, documentation, etc). You'd like to be able to update your blog without needing to rebuild all the other sections as well. You decide to split your blog off into its own site. But oh no\!

Reseed makes this process easy.&nbsp;
